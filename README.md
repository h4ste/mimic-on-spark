# mimic-on-spark
Small Java/Scala project for loading MIMIC-III datafiles into a persistent Spark SQL database.

# Compiling
To compile, run:
```shell
./gradlew jar
```
This will create a scripts folder in the current directory containing the following data-loading scripts in Unix (`.sh`) and Windows (`.bat`) variants:
- load_mimic_data: loads MIMIC-III CSV files (gzipped or unzipped) into the persistent SparkSQL tables
- load_ccs: loads CSS CSV files (gzipped or unzipped) into the persistent SparkSQL tables
as well as the following example application scripts:
- extract_haaki: detects hospital acquired acute kidney injuries (HAAKIs) and produces timestampped CSVs
- extract_hapi: detects hospital acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs) and produces timestampped CSVs
- extract_haa: detects hospital acquired anemia (HAA) and produces timestampped CSVs

These scripts were used to prepare the data for our JAMIA paper, "A customizable deep learning model for nosocomial risk prediction from critical care notes with indirect supervision": https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa004

# Loading data
To load data into a persistant SparkSQL database, first download the data from: [https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/dbsetup/](PhysioNet)
Then, you can load the MIMIC-III data with:
```shell
$ sh scripts/load_mimic_data.sh PATH/TO/MIMIC/DATA [-g] [-d DATABASENAME] [-h|--help]
```
Where `-g` indicates that the MIMIC data files are gzipped, and `-d` indicates the name of the MIMIC-III database that will be created (default: 'mimic').
Windows versions are available in `scripts/load_mimic_data.bat`.

# Loading Community data
Using the CCS data from [https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/tree/master/concepts/diagnosis](The MIMIC Code Repository), the script
`$ scripts/load_css.sh path/to/css/files` will load the CCS data.
Likewise, the script
`$ scripts/load_community_views.sh` will load various community view tables (used for examples scripts).

# Example scripts
Three example scripts are available:
- `scripts/extract_haaki.sh path/to/output/dir ` will extract Hospital Aquired Acute Kidney Injury staging information to the given directory
- `scripts/extract_hapi.sh path/to/output/dir ` will extract Hospital Aquired Pressure Injury staging information to the given directory
- `scripts/extract_haa.sh path/to/output/dir ` will extract Hospital Aquired Anemia severity information to the given directory
Windows versions are also available, various options can be viewed with by invoking the scripts with `[-h|--help]`.
